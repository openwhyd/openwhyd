        We take reasonable administrative, physical and electronic measures
        designed to safeguard and protect your information from unauthorized
        access or disclosure. This includes utilizing Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
        software, which encrypts the personal information you input, and storing
        your information in encrypted form behind a firewall designed to block
        access from outside our network. However, no security or encryption
        method can be guaranteed to protect information from hackers or human
        error.

        to protect our rights or property, or (4) to any successor or purchaser
        in a merger, acquisition, liquidation, dissolution or sale of assets.
        Your consent will not be required for disclosure in these cases, but we
        will attempt to notify you, to the extent permitted by law to do so.
