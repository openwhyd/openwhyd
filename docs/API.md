# Openwhyd API

[Openwhyd](https://openwhyd.org) is a free and open-source music curation service that allows users to create playlists of music tracks from various streaming platforms (YouTube, SoundCloud, Vimeo, Deezer...) and to discover the music posted by other users.

[![Openwhyd Demo Video](./img/openwhyd-demo-thumb.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZT8VlTV1YY 'Openwhyd Demo Video')

It's important for us that:

- users can access and download data that they contributed to Openwhyd;
- users can even use their Openwhyd account from 3rd-party software.

In order to satisfy these scenarios, we provide two APIs:

- the [**Data Export API**](#openwhyd-data-export-api) can be used to download the list of tracks of any user profile or playlist posted publicly on Openwhyd;
- the [**User API**](#openwhyd-user-api) can be used to read and update lists of tracks associated to the authenticated user.

## Openwhyd Data Export API

The goal of the Data Export API is to give free access to data that users publicly posted on Openwhyd.

This API can be used by anyone, without authentication, to download the list of tracks of:

- a user profile; (e.g. https://openwhyd.org/adrien)
- a playlist; (e.g. https://openwhyd.org/adrien/playlist/61)
- or "hot tracks". (e.g. https://openwhyd.org/hot/electro)

The list of tracks can be downloaded in several formats:

- [JSON](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript_Object_Notation);
- or as a list of URLs.

Please use these URLs responsibly: add a reasonable delay between requests, in order to not put too much pressure on our server. Thank you!

### GET Parameters

<!-- exported from https://whyd.hackpad.com/Early-API-Download-Whyd-track-listings-in-JSON-format-CTMZ8XxzRuB -->

A list of tracks can be downloaded by appending the following HTTP GET parameters to Openwhyd URLs:

- `format`: "`json`" or "`links`"
- `limit`: number of posts to return (optional, default=`20`)
- `after`: identifier of the post (a.k.a. `pId`) from which entries must be returned (optional, for pagination)

### Examples

Examples:

- https://openwhyd.org/adrien?format=json returns the last `20` tracks Adrien posted on his Openwhyd profile, in `JSON` format.
- https://openwhyd.org/adrien/playlist/10?format=links&limit=10000 returns the last `10000` tracks Adrien posted in his "electronica" playlist, as a list of URLs.

### Response format: `links`

If the `links` format was selected, Openwhyd will return a text document with one URL per posted track.

Example:

```
//soundcloud.com/deadoceans/mitski-your-best-american-girl-3#https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/249475048
//youtube.com/watch?v=If8ChYjdFdE
//alexanderbrandon.bandcamp.com/track/sunrise-on-vanaar
```

These URLs are direct links to the track's content, on their source platform. (e.g. YouTube, SoundCloud, etc...)

URLs are provided without protocol, but can be safely prefixed with `https:`.

### Response format: `json`

If the `json` format was selected, Openwhyd will return a JSON array containing one object per posted track.

Example:

```js
[
  {
    _id: '5c05b9675b1d901f32b6fe4b',
    uId: '4d94501d1f78ac091dbc9b4d',
    uNm: 'Adrien Joly',
    text: '',
    name: 'Mitski - Your Best American Girl',
    eId: '/sc/deadoceans/mitski-your-best-american-girl-3#https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/249475048',
    img: 'https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000149087394-z2wpob-t500x500.jpg',
    nbP: 6,
    nbR: 1,
    lov: [],
  },
  {
    _id: '5c0561f65b1d901f32b6fdf4',
    uId: '4d94501d1f78ac091dbc9b4d',
    uNm: 'Adrien Joly',
    text: 'merci @[Camille B](user:51483cad7e91c862b2ab6dc2) <3',
    name: 'The Posies, Burn & Shine',
    eId: '/yt/If8ChYjdFdE',
    ctx: 'bk',
    img: 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/If8ChYjdFdE/default.jpg',
    src: {
      id: 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=If8ChYjdFdE',
      name: 'The Posies, Burn &amp; Shine - YouTube',
    },
    nbP: 8,
    lov: [],
  },
];
```

The `eId` property contains the unique identifier of the track/video on its source platform:

- `/yt/xxx` is a YouTube identifier that can be translated to `https://youtube.com/watch?v=xxx`
- `/sc/xxx#http://yyy` is the SoundCloud URI of a track, followed by the URL of its audio stream
- `/vi/xxx` is a Vimeo identifier

You will find a full list of supported source platforms with their identifier prefix in the [Formats](#formats-and-appendix) section of this document.

## Openwhyd User API

The goal of the User API is to allow users to interact with their Openwhyd account from a 3rd-party software.

It can be used to read and update lists of tracks associated to the authenticated user.

In order to allow this, a session must be initiated on Openwhyd's API, by providing the user's email and password. When a session is initiated properly, a cookie will be returned. This cookie will be required for the following API requests. If you want to know more about the authentication flow, read [login-flow.md](./login-flow.md).

> Note: an API client for Node.js was written to handle the session-based authentication. It can be installed using [`npm install openwhyd-api-client`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/openwhyd-api-client).

In this section, we will document all the API endpoints supported by Openwhyd.

- arobase
- user's name, in brackets
- `user:[uId]`, in parenthesis

#### URLs for fetching images

Images can be fetched for any Openwhyd resource (tracks, user, playlists...) from a unified URL scheme, provided the id of this ressource.

The controller will either redirect to the external ressource (e.g. facebook avatars, hosted by facebook) or return the image directly. In the first case, HTTP GET parameters are passed through to the redirect URL.

URL templates:

- **/img/user/<id>**: returns a user's avatar
- **/img/userCover/<id>**: returns a user's profile cover image (banner) or a transparent pixel
- **/img/post/<id>**: returns a track's thumbnail image
- **/img/playlist/<id>**: returns a playlist's image

Specific notes about the playlist template:

- a playlist id has the following syntax: **<user id>\_<playlist number>**
