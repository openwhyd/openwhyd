# Install and run Openwhyd locally

## Using Docker (simple)

Docker makes it easy and safe to install and start the two servers required for Openwhyd: the MongoDB database server, and the web/application server (formerly called _whydJS_).

With this approach, you don't need to have Node.js installed on your computer.

If you intend to make changes to Openwhyd's source code, skip to the "Setup for development" section. Otherwise, don't forget to rebuild Openwhyd' Docker container after every change. (e.g. `docker compose up --build`)

### Prerequisites

All you need is:

- access to the shell (a.k.a. _terminal_);
- to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop);
- and to have [Git](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git) installed on your machine.

#### Note for users of Windows Home

Docker for Windows Home runs on a virtual box, so localhost may not work. For all the instructions below, if localhost is not working, replace it with your docker ip. You can find your docker ip with :

```sh
$ docker-machine ip
```

- in your web browser, http://localhost:8080 become http://your-docker-ip:8080
- replace localhost in the different scripts

### Clone and run

Commands to type in your shell:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/openwhyd/openwhyd.git
$ cd openwhyd
$ docker compose up --build --detach                # starts openwhyd's web server and database in the background
$ open http://localhost:8080                        # ... in your web browser => you should see Openwhyd's home page! ðŸŽ‰
$ docker compose down --rmi local --remove-orphans  # when you're done: stop openwhyd's web server and database
```

After making changes to the source code, don't forget to restart with `docker compose up --build --detach`, so the containers are rebuilt with the changes.

### Run automated tests

Commands to run all automated tests in Docker containers:

```sh
$ make test-in-docker
```

### Connect to the database

If you want to connect to the MongoDB database with the `mongo` shell using `docker compose` container:

```sh
$ docker compose exec mongo mongo mongodb://localhost:27117/openwhyd_test
```

---

## Setup for development

### Clone and run

Type these shell commands to run Openwhyd on your computer, against a MongoDB database running in a Docker container:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/openwhyd/openwhyd.git
$ cd openwhyd
$ nvm use                     # picks the expected version of Node.js, assuming it's installed
$ make dev                    # starts openwhyd's web server and database in the background
$ open http://localhost:8080  # ... in your web browser => you should see Openwhyd's home page! ðŸŽ‰
$ make down                   # when you're done: stop openwhyd's web server and database
```

This approach makes it more efficient than the one above to iterate on the code, because there is not need to rebuild a Docker container after every change.

### Testing

Run all tests, including approval tests:

```sh
$ make test
```

To see what other scripts are available, run:

```sh
$ make
```

And check out the list of `scripts` provided in `package.json`.

### Sample data

If you want to import some user data from openwhyd.org into your local/test database, you can use the following script:

```sh
$ make dev                              # starts openwhyd's web server and database in the background
$ make docker-seed                      # clears the database and restarts openwhyd's container
$ node scripts/import-from-prod.js test # imports 21 posts from https://openwhyd.org/test
```

After that, you will be able to sign in as an administrator using the credentials returned by the script.

The data imported can be seen from http://localhost:8080/all

## Install and run manually (advanced)

If you don't want to use Docker (or can't), you can follow these instructions.

### Setup (advanced)

- Install Node.js, MongoDB, GraphicsMagick or ImageMagick
- Make sure that `make` and `g++` are installed (required for building npm binaries, _I had to do [this](https://github.com/fedwiki/wiki/issues/46) and [this](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/questions/node-gyp-rebuild-fails-on-install)_)
- Make sure that a MongoDB server is running
- Make sure that the necessary environment variables are defined (see below)
- Make sure that the database is initialized (by running `mongo openwhyd_data config/initdb.js` and `mongo openwhyd_data config/initdb_testing.js`)
- Make sure that dependencies are installed (`npm install`)

### Usage (advanced)

- Run `npm start`, or `make start` (auto-restart daemon)
- Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) (or `WHYD_URL_PREFIX`)
- During development, you may have to restart the server to have your changes taken into account.

---

## Configuration (advanced)

### Command-line arguments

Openwhyd's entry point (`app.js`) accepts two kinds of command-line arguments:

- toggles: `--no-color`, `--fakeEmail` and `--emailAdminsOnly`; (see `FLAGS` from `app.js` for an up-to-date list)
- overrides: any app-level configuration parameter can be set, e.g. `urlPrefix` can be set as `--urlPrefix <value>`. (see `process.appParams` from `app.js` for an up-to-date list)

### Advanced use cases

#### Test email digests

If you want to test email digests locally:

```sh
$ node app.js --emailAdminsOnly --digestInterval 5000 --digestImmediate true
```

#### Map localhost to a domain name

If you want to test Deezer Connect, you will need your server to be reachable through a domain name. Here's a way to achieve that:

1. Configure your Deezer app to allow connections from `http://local.openwhyd.org:8080`;
2. Add `local.openwhyd.org` to your `/private/etc/hosts` file;
3. Flush the corresponding cache: `$ dscacheutil -flushcache`;
4. Start Openwhyd with `$ npm start -- --urlPrefix http://local.openwhyd.org:8080`.
