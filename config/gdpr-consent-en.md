**Before using Openwhyd, and in compliance with [GDPR](https://www.eugdpr.org/), please read the conditions below and give your consent if you are comfortable with them.**

## Project

- Openwhyd is an _open source_ and non-profit project.
- Its [source code](https://github.com/openwhyd/openwhyd) is maintained by volunteers. Contributions are coordinated and approved by Adrien Joly (administrator of the openwhyd.org platform since August 2016), on his spare time.
- The `openwhyd.org` domain name, the hosting server and the associated data are also managed by Adrien Joly.
- Technical costs are covered by sponsors and donors. The corresponding invoices are published on [our Opencollective page](https://opencollective.com/openwhyd).

## Use of cookies

- Cookies are used to maintain your Openwhyd session active, until you decide to sign off.
- Some cookies may be created by Facebook and Twitter, to allow you to sign into your Openwhyd account faster through your social accounts, and to display social sharing buttons.
- We don't use cookies to display targeted advertising.

## Data storage

- We've been doing our best to reduce the risk of data leak, by encoding your password with the MD5 algorithm, enabling secure SSL/HTTPS access, and the use of a firewall on our server.
- Access to our MongoDB database is restricted to Adrien Joly only.
- The service and its data are hosted by [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/security/gdpr/).

## Data processing

- Your email address is private and is never disclosed to anyone. You can change it anytime using your [settings page](https://openwhyd.org/settings), as well as your name, your password, the photos, description and social links displayed on your public profile.
- We don't spam. You can toggle notification emails from your [settings page](https://openwhyd.org/settings). Other emails from us are either expected (e.g. sign up, password reset request), mandatory (e.g. changes in our privacy policy) or particularly important otherwise (e.g. critical news about openwhyd.org or it's community of users).
- Our database is backed-up weekly by DigitalOcean, to prevent data loss.
- Usage data (e.g. sign-ups, visit logs, playback history) can be downloaded by Adrien Joly, in order to better understand anomalies and usage trends. Adrien can decide to share this anonymous data with selected tiers, for research or educational purposes.

## Data control

- You can download the list of tracks you've added to your Openwhyd account at any time, in the JSON format. (see [how to export my tracks](https://github.com/openwhyd/openwhyd/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md#how-to-export-my-tracks--comment-exporter-ma-musique-en-csv-ou-json-))
- You can delete your Openwhyd account and the underlying data (including your profile and list of tracks) directly from your [settings page](https://openwhyd.org/settings).
- For any other question or request you may have related to your data, please reach out at [privacy@openwhyd.org](mailto:privacy@openwhyd.org).

You will find the complete version of our Privacy Policy on that page: [openwhyd.org/privacy](/privacy).

- [ ] I confirm that I am 13 or older, and consent to let Openwhyd collect and process data as explained above.
