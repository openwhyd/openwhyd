### General List of Reserved Words
### Stuart P. Bentley <stuart@testtrack4.com>, June 4, 2013

## This is a general list of words you may want to consider reserving,
## in a system where users can pick any name, in a context where the
## system may use names as well. One prominent example of a system
## where this is the case would be a site that serves pages for users,
## at their username, from the site root, like
## http://twitter.com/stuartpb . In this system, you would want to
## reserve some routes for pages that would commonly be expected to
## have certain content, such as http://twitter.com/about
##
## This list is written as a very large blacklist, covering any words
## that could plausibly represent a common subject. Many of these may
## not apply for your specific context: you should really evaluate
## each word to see if you *should* reserve it, in a specific context,
## than just blindly reserving every word on the list. (It's more
## likely that a user is going to want the name "gopher" than that
## you'll need to reserve a path for serving files under the Gopher
## protocol.)
##
## It should be noted that reserving the words on this list should be
## approached from a social standpoint, as well as a technical one.
## You may want to blacklist some words as even being present in
## substrings, or using similar-looking characters: for instance,
## a user with the name "securityupdate" will have an easier time
## convincing users to run untrustworthy code.
##
## This list only includes words of at least two characters with
## alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores. Other paths
## you may need to handle specially, such as favicon.ico and
## robots.txt, are not listed.
##
## Hyphenated and otherwise compound words are included sparingly:
## only in specific cases where the specific compound has a
## notable existing presence (such as cgi-bin).
##
## Note that some words may appear in multiple contexts (such as
## "less", which is listed both as a term, and the name of a
## language.)
